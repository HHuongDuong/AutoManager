# POS Desktop UI (Static)

Open index.html in a browser to preview the POS Desktop UI.

Features:
- Product browsing and cart
- DINE_IN/TAKEAWAY selection
- Payment modal
- Offline queue simulation

Backend connection:
- Use the login modal to obtain a token from `/auth/login`.
- API base can be set in the login modal (default http://localhost:3000).

This is a static UI that can be wrapped into Electron later.
