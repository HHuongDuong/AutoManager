# POS Prototype

Open `index.html` in a browser to try the prototype.

Features:
- Browse demo products, add to cart
- Create order which is saved to local queue (simulates offline support)
- Simulate offline/online and Sync Queue (simulated send)

This is a simple static prototype to validate UX flows before implementing in React/Electron.
